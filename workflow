Choose an Appointment Date & Time:
The system shows available slots based on the doctor’s schedule.
Patients select their preferred date and time from the available options.
Confirm Appointment: The patient fills in necessary details (e.g., symptoms, reason for visit) and confirms the booking.

A confirmation screen displays the details of the booked appointment.
An email or notification can be sent to the patient and doctor with appointment details.

Mark Appointment as Completed: After the appointment, the doctor can mark it as completed and add any necessary notes for record-keeping.


5. Google Calendar Integration (Optional)
Add to Google Calendar:
Once an appointment is confirmed, it can automatically be added to both the patient’s and doctor’s Google Calendar using the Google Calendar API.
This helps keep track of appointment schedules.

Appointment (stores details of appointments like patient, doctor, date, time, status).
Feedback (if feedback is enabled for post-appointment reviews).
Prescription (doctor’s notes and any prescriptions from the appointment).
